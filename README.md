Welcome to the Front End Nerdery Discord Server. The purpose of this Discord server is to provide a place for people from all areas of front end design and development to have a place to converse and share ideas from all over the world on a wide range of topics from code to Accessibility to Typography.

We expect all members to adhere to these rules and do not tolerate harassment of any form.

Any member asked to stop their harassment or any other violation of rules will be expected to do so immediately. Compliance, when asked will be expected to be immediate.

## CONDUCT
We are dedicated and committed to providing a safe, welcoming, inclusive, and friendly environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, personal appearance, body size, level of experience, disability, mental or physical ability, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, family status or other similar characteristics.

We ask members to be considerate, respectful, and open to helping others. Commitment to a sense of community and family. To help each other and to respect others.
Be kind. Be friendly. Be courteous. Being rude does not fit the channel we have here and will not be tolerated. Avoid using sexual innuendo, jokes, tones, aliases, or nicknames that may detract from a welcoming, friendly, and inclusive experience for everyone.

Respect others opinions even if they differ from yours. There is no one right answer. Agree to disagree. Focus on resolving issues and working together in a constructive manner to solve problems or issues when they arise. We learn from our mistakes, let’s focus on helping each other and not hurting each other.

Please keep critique on-topic and civil. Do not get personal. Personal attacks will not be tolerated. Constructive criticism that helps others to help better the experience for others that do not have as much experience of those that do helps. Don’t hinder someone’s work or ideas.

Think before you type/speak. Words can create a ripple effect that can last for a long time. Choose your words wisely. Use welcoming and inclusive language, throughout this document you will find references to using such language that is welcoming, inclusive, and friendly.

Under no circumstance will there be any tolerance to insults, demeaning others, or harassment of any nature. That is not welcomed here. The following items list taken from the Citizen Code of Conduct (http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) are what we consider harassment and is unacceptable in our community and is met with a zero tolerance policy.

We will immediately terminate access to our server in the event of any rules infractions. If you have any questions on this, including definitions, please visit the Citizen Code of Conduct for clarification. We especially will not tolerate any behavior that excludes persons of any socially marginalized groups.

Private harassment is also unacceptable and not tolerated in any form. No matter who you are. If you feel you have been subjected to any harassment by any community member, please contact one of the admins immediately no matter what level you are on the server, new member or veteran member, we want you to feel safe, included and welcomed in this community and we care. Will will have your back on this, we promise.

Also not tolerated on any level is spamming, flaming, trolling, baiting, inciting, or other attention-stealing behavior. It is not tolerated, it is not welcomed, and we have a zero tolerance policy against such behavior.

Misgendering. Intentionally referring to people in a way that rejects the validity of their gender identity. Usage of one’s identity by misuse of pronouns or forms of address when interacting with community members.

Microaggressions. Patronizing language or behavior whether intentional or unintentional, that marginalize people by communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs in the following forms;

* Pedantic corrections (e.g.: “Well, to be perfectly honest...” or “Well actually...”).
* Assuming that members are not informed. Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need topics or concepts explained or defined to them without
doing research to find out how informed they are.
* Assuming people are unskilled.
* Talking over people.
* Feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic.
* Racially charged language such as “thug” or “ghetto”.
* Other language that is exclusionary such as “crazy” or “psycho”.
* Referring to another individual in a racially demeaning manner.
* Mocking one’s first language or real or perceived accent.

## OUR GOALS
We aim for a community of inclusion, diversity, and tolerance that encourages dialogue on front end design and development in many different areas. We encourage our community members to engage in activities such as;

* Being inclusive and humble.
* Engage in empathy and humility.
* Assume competence when engaged with others.
* Listen attentively and actively.
* Ask questions and strive for understanding. There are no “stupid questions”.
* Encourage others as you would like to be encouraged as well.
* Remember that you were once just beginning on your journey like some others may be.
* Respect others time. Research before asking questions that may be duplicates of others in other channels.
* Be open and honest about your intentions especially when sharing. If something has a cost attached to it, respect others by sharing that and being honest about it.

## REPORTING ABUSE
If you have been harassed, have seen that someone else has been harassed, or have any other issues or concerns, please report the activity to an admin in a direct message and they will respond as quickly as they can. Admins and moderators will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse and the maintenance of anonymity. At the discretion of the admins, we may publicly name a person who has engaged in any violation of the Code
of Conduct about whom we have received complaints of harassment or privately warn third parties about them. We will not divulge or name harassment victims without their affirmatory consent.

## MODERATION
Community members that are asked to stop engaging in such behaviors that are in violation of this Code of Conduct must comply immediately. If a participant engages in any harassing behavior, an admin or moderator may take action they feel appropriate including a warning of that member up to expulsion from this server and
identifying the participant publicly as someone that we have received complaints about.
